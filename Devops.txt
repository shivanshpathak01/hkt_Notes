-> "localhost:3000" here localhost is the domain name, google.com, google is domain name
-> IPV4 Address => 132.22.22.239  ==> each chunk before . only go from 0 to 255, it can only be of 8 bits
-> IPV4 Address => 1320151.22.22.239  ==> not a IPV4 Address
-> IPV4 are very limited, as 256^4 are the numbers of IPV4 Addresses, that's why IPV6 came into picture, and a normal small company can't own them, we have to borrow or take it form cloud service providers
-> There is some concept of the intranet, in which there is range set, in which you have the access to the network through a specific IP, but when you are outside that range, the same IP is been given to some other domain
-> Also in intranet, when multiple people are connected to the same router, they all would be able to view the localhost that someone is using on their network
-> The above thing can be achieved by doing both, either by localhost, or by getting the IP of your router and going on that IP 
-> To get the IP Address of router that is connected : go to cmd -> ipconfig/all
-> after getting the ip, you can open the running server on any of the device that is connected to the same network
-> Always do npx serve to get the localhost as well as IP of the running port 
-> VM(Virtual Machine) : There is Hardware-> hypervisor -> VMs 
-> according to need we can optimize this as they are virtual, so cost friendly
-> Hypervisor (can be both either software or Hardware) divides the resources needed by VMs, according to their usecase
-> Maximum thing can be deployed on this virtual Machine but whenever you need something that have some extra throughput like : bitcoin mining type thing where you need excessive throughput, there only bare metal comes into picture
-> Bare Metal Servers : in a bare metal setup, OS runs directly on the physical hardware without a hypervisor in between, there is no virtualization layer
-> they are fixed and can't be virtualized, also can't be accessed easily, they can't be found easily 
-> ex: latitude.sh

-> SSH Protocol( password based Auth): protocol that allows secure communication b/w two systems, typically for remote administration.
-> when we validate a password we get shell access to that machine, this is called SSH
-> cloud Provider : AWS,GCP,Azure       EasyOne:Civo,DigitalOcean,vultr
-> Every Cloud provider will have their own name for their VMs like : AWS-> EC2(Elastic Compute 2nd generation), DigitalOcean-> droplets
-> So by signining up, and paying them , we get a public IP.
-> And the thing is that we get a ubuntu machine running my tasks that i will add, on the server of teh service provider, and i will be able to host my website or do anything on that server that they have provided to me 
-> We can clone git repo there and do whatever thing we are doing on our local machine 
-> we can give the url [239.25.1.21:3000], which includes ip and the port number where you are running your task

Keypair Based-Authentication : 
-> In an org, if we do the work using the passwords, then we can't find the person who can do the wrong things
-> To tackle that we use ssh keys, through these too we can get what we want but in a different manner
